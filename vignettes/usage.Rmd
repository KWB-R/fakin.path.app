Once you have installed the package fakin.path.app and all related packages, 
you are set up to 

1. Scan your file system for file paths and file properties and save them to 
CSV files (CSV = Comma Separated Values),

2. Run the Web Application to analyse the path information produced in the
first step.

## Step 1: Scan your file system

## Step 2: Run the Web Application

```{r}
# Set the path to your personal "path database" (a folder containing files as
# e.g. generated )

fakin.path.app::run_app(path_database)
```
